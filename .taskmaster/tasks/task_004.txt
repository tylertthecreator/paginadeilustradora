# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the contact page with a functional form for inquiries and add social media links to the site's footer.
# Details:
Create a `Contact` page component that includes a form with fields for name, email, and message. Implement form validation. Integrate a service like EmailJS for form submissions. Add Instagram and LinkedIn icons (using React Icons) with direct links to the footer.

# Test Strategy:
Test the contact form validation by submitting with empty/invalid fields. Send a test submission and verify it is received via the EmailJS service. Click the social media icons in the footer to confirm they link to the correct profiles.
