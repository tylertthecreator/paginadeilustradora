# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 4, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Refine the overall user experience by adding smooth page transitions and micro-interactions like hover effects.
# Details:
Use Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` or a similar feature to add smooth transitions between page routes. Add subtle hover effects to buttons, navigation links, and gallery items to provide visual feedback to the user.

# Test Strategy:
Navigate between all pages and confirm that transitions are smooth. Hover over all interactive elements to ensure they have the intended effects. Check for performance issues related to the animations.
