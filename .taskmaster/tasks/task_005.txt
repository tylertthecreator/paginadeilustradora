# Task ID: 5
# Title: Define and Implement Data Structure for Artwork
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a simple, file-based data management system using JSON files to store metadata for all artwork.
# Details:
Create a `data` directory to hold JSON files. Define a schema for artwork metadata (e.g., id, title, description, category, imageSrc). Populate a JSON file with sample data for both ceramics and bags. Organize corresponding images in the `/public` folder.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the JSON file structure against the defined schema. Write a simple script or component to read and log the JSON data to the console to ensure it's parseable and correct.
