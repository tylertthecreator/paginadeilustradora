# Task ID: 3
# Title: Set Up Page Routing and Static Content Pages
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure the application's routing and create the initial static pages for 'About Me' and 'Shop' as per the content structure.
# Details:
Use Next.js App Router to set up routes for `/`, `/about`, `/work`, `/shop`, and `/contact`. Create the 'About Me' page with placeholder text sections. Build the 'Shop' page featuring a prominent button/link to the external Etsy store.

# Test Strategy:
Navigate to each of the defined routes (`/about`, `/shop`, etc.) to ensure they render the correct page component. Confirm the Etsy link on the shop page is correct and functional.
