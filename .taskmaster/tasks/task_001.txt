# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Next.js Project with Core Dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational Next.js project environment, including TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for styling, as outlined in Phase 1 of the development roadmap.
# Details:
Create a new Next.js 14+ project using `create-next-app`. Configure it to use TypeScript. Install and configure Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. Install Framer Motion and React Icons as additional dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the Next.js development server runs without errors. Confirm that Tailwind CSS utility classes can be applied to a basic component and are rendered correctly in the browser.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Scaffold Next.js Project with TypeScript [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use the `create-next-app` CLI tool to generate a new Next.js 14+ project, ensuring TypeScript is selected during the setup process.
### Details:
Execute `npx create-next-app@latest` and follow the interactive prompts. Ensure you select 'Yes' for using TypeScript and the App Router.

## 2. Install and Configure Tailwind CSS [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the Tailwind CSS framework into the project for utility-first styling, following the official integration guide for Next.js.
### Details:
Install `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`. Run `npx tailwindcss init -p` to generate `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js`. Update the `content` property in `tailwind.config.ts` and add the `@tailwind` directives to `app/globals.css`.

## 3. Install Additional Dependencies (Framer Motion & React Icons) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add Framer Motion for animations and React Icons for the icon library to the project's dependencies.
### Details:
Run the command `npm install framer-motion react-icons` in the project's root directory.

## 4. Clean Up Boilerplate and Structure Project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove the default Next.js example content from the main page and establish a basic folder structure for future development.
### Details:
Clear the default JSX from `app/page.tsx` and replace it with a simple placeholder (e.g., an `<h1>`). Create a `components` directory inside the `app` or root directory to house future reusable components.

## 5. Initialize Git and Create First Commit [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish version control for the new project by initializing a Git repository and making an initial commit of the configured setup.
### Details:
Ensure a `.gitignore` file is present and correctly configured. Stage all project files (`git add .`) and create the first commit with a descriptive message like 'feat: Initialize Next.js project with core dependencies'.

## 6. Create Next.js Project with TypeScript and App Router [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use the `create-next-app` command-line tool to generate a new Next.js 14+ project. Ensure that TypeScript, ESLint, and the App Router are selected during the setup process.
### Details:
Run `npx create-next-app@latest` and follow the prompts to configure the project. Select 'Yes' for TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and the `src/` directory. Select 'Yes' for App Router.

## 7. Finalize Tailwind CSS Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Although `create-next-app` provides a basic setup, review and finalize the Tailwind CSS configuration to ensure it's ready for project-specific customizations.
### Details:
Verify that `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js` were created correctly. Confirm that the `content` array in `tailwind.config.ts` correctly points to `./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}`. Ensure the `@tailwind` directives are present at the top of `src/styles/globals.css`.

## 8. Clean Up Default Boilerplate Code and Styles [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove the default example content and styles from the home page (`page.tsx`) and the global stylesheet (`globals.css`) to provide a clean slate for development.
### Details:
Delete all content within the `<main>` tag in `src/app/page.tsx` and replace it with a simple `<h1>` tag. Remove all CSS rules from `src/styles/globals.css` except for the three `@tailwind` directives at the top of the file.

## 9. Install Framer Motion and React Icons [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add Framer Motion for animations and React Icons for the icon library to the project's dependencies, as they are required for future components.
### Details:
Execute `npm install framer-motion react-icons` in the project's root directory to add the two libraries. Verify that they have been added to the `dependencies` section in the `package.json` file.

## 10. Verify Integration of All Core Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a temporary test case on the home page to confirm that Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and React Icons are all functioning correctly within the Next.js environment.
### Details:
Modify `src/app/page.tsx` to import `motion` from `framer-motion` and an icon (e.g., `FaReact`) from `react-icons/fa`. Render a `<motion.div>` with a simple animation, apply a Tailwind utility class (e.g., `text-blue-500 text-4xl`), and include the imported icon inside it.
