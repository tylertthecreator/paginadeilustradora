# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Gallery Filtering and Lightbox
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the gallery with functionality to filter artwork by category and view individual pieces in a detailed lightbox modal.
# Details:
Add UI controls (e.g., buttons) to the gallery page to filter artwork by category ('ceramics', 'bags'). Implement a modal/lightbox component that opens when a gallery item is clicked, displaying a larger image and its details.

# Test Strategy:
Test the category filters to ensure they correctly show/hide artwork. Click on multiple gallery items to verify the lightbox opens with the correct image and data. Test the lightbox closing functionality.
