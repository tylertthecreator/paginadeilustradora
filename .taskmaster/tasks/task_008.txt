# Title: Create Animated 4x4 Photo Grid Component
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the eye-catching 4x4 animated photo grid component using Framer Motion for a dynamic visual effect.
# Details:
Build a new component that displays a 4x4 grid of square images. Use Framer Motion to implement a continuous, subtle animation effect (e.g., moving, rotating) similar to the reference site. Use optimized 4x4 square images for this component.

# Test Strategy:
Render the component on a page and verify the 4x4 grid displays correctly. Observe the animation to ensure it is smooth and not performance-intensive. Check for any console errors from Framer Motion.
