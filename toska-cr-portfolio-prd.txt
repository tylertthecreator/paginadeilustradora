- Implement category filtering for different art types (ceramics, bags, etc.)
- Create animated 4x4 photo grid component (moving/rotating effect)
- Add image lightbox/modal for detailed viewing
- Optimize all images for web performance

## Phase 4: Polish & Performance
- Add smooth page transitions and hover effects
- Implement SEO optimization (meta tags, structured data)

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Project Setup** → Basic Next.js environment with dependencies
2. **Layout Foundation** → Header, footer, navigation before any pages
3. **Routing & Basic Pages** → Page structure before complex features
4. **Static Content** → About and Contact pages (simpler) before gallery
5. **Gallery System** → Image display before animations
6. **Animation Features** → Advanced photo grid effects last
7. **Performance & SEO** → Optimization after core functionality works
