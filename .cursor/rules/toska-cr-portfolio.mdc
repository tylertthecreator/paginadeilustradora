# Toska CR Portfolio - Project Guidelines

This document outlines the core design decisions, architectural patterns, and development workflow for the Toska CR portfolio website. These rules ensure consistency and quality in all future development.

## Core Directives for AI Collaboration

These are the high-level principles that guide the AI assistant's work on this project:

-   **Always Verify**: After any change, check the terminal console for new errors or warnings. If any are found, they must be fixed immediately.
-   **Prioritize Consistency**: Ensure all new code and styling matches the established patterns defined in these rules.
-   **Minimal & Precise Changes**: Opt for the smallest, most targeted change possible to achieve the goal. Avoid major refactoring unless it is the only viable solution and has been discussed first.

## 1. Brand Identity & Color Palette

The brand's aesthetic is defined by a specific color palette. These colors must be used consistently across the application.

-   **Primary Background**: Dark Teal/Green (`#0f2e1f` or `bg-brand-dark-teal`). Used for the Header, Footer, and the Hero section.
-   **Primary Accent**: Vibrant Pink (`#FF8A9D` or `text-brand-vibrant-pink`). Used for key text elements like navigation links, titles ("My Work"), and important accents.
-   **Secondary Accent**: Cream (`#f5efe1` or `bg-brand-cream`). Used for specific UI elements like the "See All" button background and the text in the Skills section.
-   **Skills Section Background**: The Skills section uses the vibrant pink (`#FF8A9D`) as its background color.

## 2. Typography System

Consistent typography is crucial for the brand's feel.

-   **Primary Fonts**: The preferred font families are **Mencken** and **Temeraire**.
-   **Header Navigation**: Font size must be `20px` and `bold`.
-   **"My Work" Title**: Font size must be `60px` and `bold`.
-   **Skills Section Text**: Font size must be `40px` and `bold`.

## 3. Layout & Spacing

A spacious, edge-to-edge layout is a core design principle.

-   **Edge-to-Edge Layout**: Primary sections like the Header, Footer, and Skills section should span the full width of the viewport.
-   **Consistent Padding**:
    -   **Header & Footer**: Must have `40px` of horizontal padding on the left and right edges.
    -   **Skills Section**: Must have `30px` of horizontal padding.

## 4. Component-Specific Styles

Key components have very specific styling rules that must be maintained.

-   **Header**:
    -   The `BrandLogo` component must be used in its icon-only form (`showText={false}`).
    -   The `ShoppingBagIcon` must be visually larger to balance the layout.
    -   Navigation links must be right-aligned with `60px` of space separating them from the shopping icon.
-   **Footer**:
    -   Must have a dark green background (`#0f2e1f`) and pink text for links and social icons.
-   **Interactive Carousel**:
    -   This component is the standard for horizontally scrolling image galleries.

## 5. Technical Patterns

-   **Client vs. Server Components**: Use the `'use client';` directive for components that require React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`). Keep components that are primarily for layout or need to export metadata as Server Components.
-   **Git Repository**: The official remote for this project is `https://github.com/tylertthecreator/paginadeilustradora.git`.
